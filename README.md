To Analyze the Data of the Price and Size of Ladies Diamond Rings

The dataset provided in the link below contains the prices of ladies&#39; diamond rings and
the carat size of their diamond stones. The rings are made with gold of 20 carats purity and are
each mounted with a single diamond stone. The article associated with this dataset appears in the
Journal of Statistics Education, Volume 4, Number 3 (1996).

<h2><u>Objectives</u></h2>
•	To make the scatter plot between the prize & size of the rings.<br>
•	To fit a simple linear regression model using Price as a response variable.<br>
•	To test for significance of the Size to determine the price of the ring.<br>
•	To predict the price of a ring of size 0.24 carat. Construct a 95% confidence interval and prediction interval for the predicted price.

<h2><u>Procedure</u></h2>
•	Importing data in R.<br>
•	Inserting the variable names: Size and Price for column 1 and column 2 respectively.<br>
•	 Display the Size and Price of the rings using scatterplot.<br>
•	Making the equation of the linear regression model.<br>
•	Testing the data for significance.<br>
•	Predicting the price of the ring for a given size.<br>
